# Pytest configuration file
# Test configuration is loaded from config/test/hpo_pipeline.yaml for integration tests

# Test discovery patterns
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*

# Test paths
testpaths = tests

# Plugins (pytest_configure.py hooks are auto-discovered)
# Ensure tests/pytest_configure.py is in Python path

# Output options
addopts = 
    -v
    --strict-markers
    --tb=short
    --disable-warnings

# Markers
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: Integration tests (slower, may require external resources)
    e2e: End-to-end workflow tests (standalone scripts, not pytest-based)
    slow: Slow tests that take significant time

# Note: E2E tests in tests/e2e/ are standalone scripts (not pytest-based)
# They should be run directly: python tests/e2e/test_e2e_workflow.py

# Coverage options (when using pytest-cov)
# To run with coverage: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
# Coverage thresholds can be enforced via --cov-fail-under
