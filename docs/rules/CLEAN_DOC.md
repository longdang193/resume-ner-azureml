* **Visuals**: Use diagrams, flowcharts, screenshots, or tables to support explanations.
* **Concrete examples**: Provide real-world examples users can relate to.

## D5: Modular, Maintainable Documentation

* **Modularity**: Break content into self-contained sections that can be updated independently.
* **Version Control**: Use version control for documents that evolve frequently.
* **Update Regularly**: Keep documentation aligned with system changes and new releases.

### D5.1: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

* **Eliminate Redundancy**: Avoid repeating information across documents.

* **Cross-Reference**: Reference related sections instead of duplicating content.

## D6: Accessible and Discoverable

* **Searchability**: Ensure users can quickly find key topics.

## D8: Keep Documentation Simple and Avoid Over-Explaining

* **Simplify**: Break down complex concepts into digestible parts.
* **Minimalist Approach**: Explain only what helps the user accomplish their task.
* **Clear Terminology**: Define necessary terms without excessive detail.

## D9: Document Errors, Exceptions, and Edge Cases

* **Error Handling**: Document error codes and resolutions.
* **Edge Cases**: Clarify less common but important behaviors users may encounter.

## D10: Review, Test, and Iterate

* **Peer Review**: Have someone else validate accuracy and usability.
* **Test**: Validate that instructions work as written.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Update documentation based on feedback and product changes.

## D11: Use a Style Guide
