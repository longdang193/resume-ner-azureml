# MLflow Tracking Configuration
# This file centralizes MLflow tracking settings for all platforms

# Azure ML Workspace Configuration (for unified tracking)
# If enabled, all platforms will use Azure ML Workspace for MLflow tracking
# If disabled or unavailable, each platform uses local SQLite tracking
azure_ml:
  enabled: true  # Set to true to enable Azure ML Workspace tracking
  workspace_name: "resume-ner-ws"  # Must match config/infrastructure.yaml
  # Credentials are loaded from environment variables:
  # - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
  # - AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
  # - DefaultAzureCredential is used for authentication

# Local Tracking Configuration (fallback when Azure ML is disabled/unavailable)
local:
  # Platform-specific paths are automatically resolved:
  # - Colab: /content/drive/MyDrive/resume-ner-mlflow/mlflow.db (if Drive mounted)
  #          /content/mlflow.db (if Drive not mounted)
  # - Kaggle: /kaggle/working/mlflow.db
  # - Local: ./mlruns/mlflow.db
  # No configuration needed - paths are platform-aware

# Experiment Naming
# Experiment names are built from experiment config and stage
# Format: "{experiment_name}-{stage}-{backbone}"
# Example: "resume_ner_baseline-hpo-distilbert"
# This is handled automatically by build_mlflow_experiment_name()
